## 3.1. Arrays
- Definition: An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values, all sharing the same data type (either primitive or reference types).
- Uniform Data Type: All elements in an array must be of the same type. For example, an array declared to hold integers cannot store strings.
- Declaration: Specify the type and use square brackets ([]) to denote that you are declaring an array. Example:
```Java
int[] numbers;	
```
- Array Creation Expression: The expression after the assignment (=) allocates memory for the array and initializes elements to default values. Example:
```Java
numbers = new int[5];
```
- Array Initializer (Shortcut): You can also initialize an array using an initializer, which both sets the elements and determines the arrayâ€™s size. Example:
```Java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```
#### Access and Limitations
- Indexing: Arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0. Accessing an index out of range throws an exception.
- Fixed Size: Once created, the size of an array is fixed. You cannot add or remove elements dynamically.
- Internal Representation: Arrays are objects in Java. They have a public field length and support cloning via the clone() method.
- Type Checking: Array type checking is performed at runtime. Arrays are covariant, meaning an array of a subclass can be assigned to an array reference of its superclass, which may lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.

#### 3.2. ArrayList
- Implementation: ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface.
- Advantages Over Arrays: Dynamic Resizing: The list automatically grows or shrinks as needed.
- Ease of Modification: Inserting and removing elements is simpler compared to a fixed-size array.

- Key Terms:
	- Size: The number of elements currently stored.
	- Capacity: The length of the internal array that backs the ArrayList. It can be larger than the current size.

- Constructors:
	- ArrayList(): Creates an empty list.
	- ArrayList(Collection c): Creates a list with the contents of another collection.
	- ArrayList(int initialCapacity): Creates a list with a specified initial capacity.

- Efficiency Methods:
	- ensureCapacity(): Pre-allocates storage to minimize reallocation.
	- trimToSize(): Adjusts the capacity to match the current size.

- Adding Elements:
	- add(E e): Adds an element to the end.
	- add(int index, E element): Inserts an element at a specific position.
	- addAll(Collection< extends E> c): Adds all elements from another collection.

- Retrieving Elements:
	- get(int index): Returns the element at the specified position.
	- indexOf(Object o): Finds the index of a specified element.

- Other Utility Methods:
	- isEmpty(): Checks if the list is empty.
	- size(): Returns the number of elements.
	- toString(): Provides a string representation of the list.

- Iterator: The iterator() method returns an Iterator that allows you to traverse the list using hasNext() and next() methods.

3. Generics in Java
- Type Safety: Without generics, collections store elements as Object, which requires explicit casting when retrieving them. This can lead to runtime errors like ClassCastException.
- Eliminates the Need for Casting: By specifying a type parameter, such as ArrayList<~String>, the compiler ensures that only objects of type String are stored and retrieved, preventing type mismatch errors at compile time.
- Improves Code Readability: Generics make the code easier to understand by explicitly stating what types are used in a collection.
- Before Generics:
```Java
ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
list.add("Hello");
String s = (String) list.get(0);
```
- With Generics:
```Java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Hello");
String s = list.get(0);
```
