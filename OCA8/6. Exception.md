## 6.1. Purpose and Overview of Exceptions

#### Managing Unexpected Situations
Exceptions are used to handle error situations (e.g., file-not-found, invalid input) that are not part of the normal program flow. They represent “exceptional” conditions—errors that occur at runtime and need a safe, alternative path.

#### Alternative Flow Design
Instead of letting the program crash, exceptions allow you to provide meaningful feedback (e.g., error messages) and alternate behaviors, ensuring the program fails gracefully or recovers.

### Communication Between Developers and Users
Developers design exception handling so that errors are either solved programmatically or passed on (via `throws`) to higher-level components, while also providing users with clear error messages or fallback actions.

## 6.2. Try-Catch-Finally and Exception Propagation

#### Try-Catch Structure
- **Try Block**: Encloses code that might throw an exception.
- **Catch Block(s)**: Provide specific handlers for different types of exceptions. The `catch` clause specifies which exception type it handles.
- **Finally Block**: (Optional) Contains code that always executes (such as resource cleanup), regardless of whether an exception occurred. Note that if `System.exit()` is called, the `finally` block might not run.

#### Exception Propagation
- **Throws Clause**: Methods that might throw checked exceptions must declare them using the `throws` clause.
- **Throw Statement**: Used to explicitly throw an exception object when a condition is detected.

#### Handling vs. Propagating
If a method cannot handle an exception, it propagates it to its caller, who must either handle it or declare it in its own signature.

## 6.3. Types of Exceptions and Errors

#### Checked Exceptions
- Must be declared in a method’s signature or handled within the method.
- Represent conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch (e.g., `IOException`, `FileNotFoundException`).

#### Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
- Do not require explicit declaration or handling.
- Usually indicate programming errors (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`).
- They occur at runtime and signal bugs that need to be fixed during development.

#### Errors
- Represent serious problems that are not expected to be caught by applications (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`).
- Generally thrown by the JVM when it encounters issues that compromise the runtime environment.

#### Throwable Hierarchy
- All exceptions and errors are subclasses of `java.lang.Throwable`.
- The stack trace stored in a `Throwable` object provides detailed debugging information about where the error occurred.

## 6.4. Best Practices and Key Concepts

#### Handling vs. Swallowing Exceptions
- Always handle exceptions appropriately rather than simply catching and ignoring them.
- Print stack traces or log useful information to aid debugging if an exception occurs.

#### Designing Methods with Exceptions
- Clearly document (via `throws`) which checked exceptions a method might throw.
- Balance the specificity of thrown exceptions to avoid overwhelming users with too many types or overly generic exception declarations.

#### Polymorphism and Overriding (Related Concept)
- When overriding methods, ensure that the overriding method’s exceptions are compatible with those declared in the overridden method.
- This maintains consistency and ensures that the exception contracts are preserved across the class hierarchy.

#### User Communication
It is the developer’s responsibility to inform users of potential error situations and, if possible, allow them to correct the problem (e.g., re-entering input).
