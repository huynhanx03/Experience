## 4.1. Java String Basics

#### Definition & Nature
A Java `String` is an instance of the `final String` class representing a sequence of characters. Literal strings like `"Hello"` are created as objects of this class.

#### Key Constructors
- `String()`
- `String(String str)`
- `String(byte[] bytes)`
- `String(char[] chars)`

#### Immutability
Once created, a `String`â€™s content cannot be changed. Operations that seem to modify a `String` (e.g., `concat()`, `replace()`) return a new `String` object.

## 4.2. String Operations & Methods

#### Access & Manipulation
- Use methods like `charAt()`, `substring()`, `toLowerCase()`/`toUpperCase()`, `trim()`, and `replace()`.
- `toString()` (inherited from `Object`) is overridden to provide a meaningful representation.

#### Concatenation
- The `+` operator (and compound `+=`) combines strings.
- String concatenation triggers conversion of non-string operands via their `toString()` method.

#### Comparison
- Use `equals()` (compares content) and `compareTo()` (for lexicographical order) rather than the `==` operator, which checks reference equality.

## 4.3. Memory Management and the String Pool

#### Memory Storage
All objects reside on the heap, but string literals are stored in the **String pool** (intern pool) to maintain a set of unique, reusable strings.

#### String Pool Benefits
- Saves memory by reusing existing objects for identical literals.
- Allows fast comparisons with `==` for interned strings.

#### Escape Characters
Special characters must be escaped (e.g., `\n`, `\t`) because they have reserved meanings.

## 4.4. StringBuilder and Efficient String Manipulation

#### Why Use StringBuilder
Because `String`s are immutable, frequent modifications (such as in loops) create many temporary objects. `StringBuilder` offers a mutable alternative.

#### Key Features
- Provides methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `delete()`, `reverse()`, and `toString()`.
- Has a **capacity** (total available space) and a **size** (current length), allowing efficient modifications.

#### When to Use
Use `StringBuilder` (or `StringBuffer` in multi-threaded contexts) for performance-critical scenarios involving heavy string manipulation.
