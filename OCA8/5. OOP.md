## 5.1. Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (fields) and behavior (methods) of the objects. Together, fields and methods make up the members of a class.

- Fields: Variables that hold the state (data) of an object.
- Methods: Functions that define behavior and operations on objects.

#### 5.1.1. Object Fields and Instance Access


###### Instance (Object) Fields:
- Every object (instance) of a class maintains its own copy of its instance fields.
- These fields hold the state (data) for that particular object.

###### Accessing Fields:
- Reference Variable: To access an instance field, you must have a reference variable that points to the object.
- Dot Operator (.): Use the dot operator to access fields and methods (e.g., object.field or object.method()).
- Direct Method Invocation Without a Reference Variable: It’s possible to create an object and immediately call a method on it without storing the reference (e.g., new MyClass().printName();).
- Limitation: Without a reference variable, instance fields cannot be directly accessed because the field belongs to a specific object.

#### 5.1.2. The “this” Keyword
###### Purpose of “this”:
- Refers to the current object—the instance on which a method is invoked.
- Helps distinguish between instance fields and local variables when they share the same name.

###### Usage Guidelines:
- Inside Instance Methods: Use this to access fields and call other instance methods.
- Disambiguation: When method parameters or local variables have the same name as instance fields, prefixing with this clarifies that you mean the object’s field (e.g., this.value = value;).
- Static Context: this cannot be used in static methods or static initializers since there is no instance context.
- Accessing Static Fields: While using this to access static fields in instance methods is allowed (because an instance exists), it’s considered poor style compared to using the class name.

###### Quick Facts About “this”:
- It is a reserved keyword in Java.
- Its type is the current class.
- It behaves like a final reference; you can assign it to another variable, but its value never changes.


#### 5.1.3. Object Instantiation and Initialization
###### Instantiation Process:

- Class Initialization: The JVM loads the class and initializes static fields.

- Memory Allocation: Memory is allocated for the new object.

- Instance Field Initialization: Instance fields are set to default values (0, false, null, etc.).

- Instance Initializers and Constructor Execution:

	- Instance Initializer Blocks: Blocks of code (within braces {} outside of any method) execute in order and have full access to instance fields (including via this).
	
	- Constructor: The constructor completes the initialization process with any additional custom logic.

- Key Point: The instance is considered “ready-to-use” only after all these steps have been completed.

#### 5.1.4. Constructors
###### Characteristics of Constructors
- Special Method: Constructors are used to create and initialize objects.

- No Return Type: They do not return any value, not even void.

- Name Matching: A constructor’s name must exactly match the class name.

- Distinction: A method with the same name as the class but with a return type is not a constructor.

###### Default Constructor
- Automatic Provision: The compiler provides a default constructor only if no constructors are explicitly declared.

- Characteristics:

	- Takes no arguments.
	
	- Uses the default (package-private) access level if no modifier is specified.
	
	- Declares no exceptions.
	
	- Has an empty body, performing no custom initialization.

- Clarification: Although often called a “default no-args constructor,” its primary role is to ensure basic object initialization. If you delegate initialization to another method and forget to call it, the object may not be properly initialized—hence the constructor is the proper place for such tasks.

###### Constructor Overloading and Chaining
- Constructor Overloading: A class can have multiple constructors, each with a different parameter list, providing various ways to initialize objects.

- Constructor Chaining: 
	- Use this() to call one constructor from another.
	
	- Key Rule: The this() call must be the first statement in a constructor and can be used only once per constructor.
	
	- Common Error: Failing to follow these rules (for instance, using another constructor call syntax or placing it later in the constructor) will lead to compile-time errors.


#### 5.1.5. Variable Scope and Lifespan
###### Scope (Visibility)
- Class-Level (Instance/Static Fields): These variables are accessible throughout the class and, depending on their access modifiers, beyond the class.

- Method Scope: Local variables declared within a method are accessible only within that method.

- Block Scope: Variables declared within blocks (such as within if, for, or switch statements) are visible only inside those blocks.

- Accessing Variables: To use class-level variables within methods, you must reference them directly (or via this for instance fields) because they exist in a broader context than local variables.

###### Lifespan (Lifetime)
- Instance and Static Variables: They exist as long as the object or the class is loaded in memory.

- Local Variables: Their lifespan is limited to the execution of the method or block in which they are declared.

- Loop Variables: Variables declared inside loops are reinitialized on each iteration and are discarded after the loop finishes.

- Analogy for Clarity: Think of “scope” as the context or environment in which a word (like “president”) is meaningful. Just as a “president” can refer to different roles depending on the context (e.g., country vs. sports association), a variable’s scope defines where it can be used and how long it exists in the program.

#### 5.1.6. Access Modifiers and Encapsulation
###### Access Modifiers:

- Public: Accessible from any other class.

- Protected: Accessible within the same package or subclasses (even if they’re in different packages).

- Default (Package-Private): Accessible only within the same package.

- Private: Accessible only within the class in which they are declared.

- Modifier Order: The typical order follows: public > protected > default > private. Note that combinations like “public protected” are invalid.

###### Encapsulation:

- Definition: The practice of bundling the data (fields) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).

- Benefits:
	- Data Hiding: Internal details are hidden, reducing dependencies between classes.
	- Maintainability: Changes in implementation can be made without affecting other parts of the program.
	- Controlled Access: Fields are typically declared private, and access is provided through getters and setters.

- Best Practice: Use methods to expose behavior rather than allowing direct access to fields.

#### 5.1.7. Inheritance
Inheritance is an object-oriented mechanism in which a class (called a subclass or child) acquires properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) from another class (called a superclass or parent). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy between classes.

```Java
class Animal {
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Dog inherits speak() from Animal.
    // It can override it to provide its own behavior.
    @Override
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class InheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Animal();
        a.speak();  // Output: Animal speaks

        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.speak();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

###### Parameter Names and Field Shadowing
A field in a class can have the same name as a method parameter because they are in different scopes. When a method parameter has the same name as a field, the parameter “shadows” the field. To access the field, you use the this keyword.

```Java
class Person {
    private String name;  // Field

    public Person(String name) { // Parameter shadows the field
        this.name = name;       // 'this.name' accesses the field
    }

    public void printName() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Alice");
        p.printName();  // Output: Name: Alice
    }
}
```


###### Overriding vs. Hiding Methods

- Overriding (for Instance Methods):

	- A subclass can override a method from its superclass by providing a new implementation with the same signature.

	- Overriding is resolved at runtime (dynamic dispatch).

- Hiding (for Static Methods):

	- If a subclass declares a static method with the same signature as in the superclass, it hides the superclass method.

	- Hiding is resolved at compile time based on the reference type.

```Java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display()");
    }
    
    static void staticDisplay() {
        System.out.println("Parent staticDisplay()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display()");
    }
    
    // Hides Parent's staticDisplay()
    static void staticDisplay() {
        System.out.println("Child staticDisplay()");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.display();         // Output: Child display() (overridden)
        p.staticDisplay();   // Output: Parent staticDisplay() (hidden, based on reference type)
    }
}
```

###### Constructors in Inheritance

- Constructors are not inherited. When a subclass is created, it must call one of its parent's constructors, either explicitly using super() or implicitly if a no-argument constructor exists.
- The call to super() must be the first statement in the subclass constructor.

```Java
class Vehicle {
    String type;

    public Vehicle(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    String model;

    public Car(String type, String model) {
        super(type);  // Calls the Vehicle constructor
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("Type: " + type + ", Model: " + model);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("Sedan", "Toyota Camry");
        car.printDetails(); // Output: Type: Sedan, Model: Toyota Camry
    }
}
```

#### 5.1.8. Abstract 
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint for subclasses by providing common fields, concrete (implemented) methods, and abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses.

Key Points:
- Cannot be Instantiated: You cannot create an object of an abstract class.

- May Contain Both Concrete and Abstract Methods: It can have fully implemented methods as well as methods declared without a body.

- Used for Inheritance: Abstract classes provide a common template for subclasses.

- Cannot be Final: Since abstract classes are meant to be extended, they cannot be declared as final.

```Java
abstract class Animal {
    // Concrete method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Animal is sleeping...");
    }
    
    // Abstract method
    public abstract void makeSound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks: Woof!");
    }
}

public class AbstractClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Animal a = new Animal(); // Error: Cannot instantiate an abstract class
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sleep();        // Output: Animal is sleeping...
        dog.makeSound();    // Output: Dog barks: Woof!
    }
}
```

###### Abstract Methods
An abstract method is declared without an implementation (no body). It specifies a method signature that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

Key Points:

- No Implementation: The method is declared with the abstract keyword and ends with a semicolon.

- Must Be Overridden: Any concrete subclass must provide an implementation for all abstract methods inherited from the abstract class.

- Not Allowed Modifiers: Abstract methods cannot be static, final, or private.

```Java
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method for calculating area
    abstract double calculateArea();
    
    // Concrete method
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;
    
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        circle.display();  // Output: This is a shape.
        System.out.println("Area: " + circle.calculateArea());
    }
}
```

###### Multi-Level Inheritance with Abstract Classes
An abstract class can extend another abstract class. A subclass that extends an abstract class may itself be abstract or must implement all inherited abstract methods if it is concrete.

Key Points:

- Inheritance Hierarchy: You can have an abstract class extend another abstract class, and then a concrete class extends that hierarchy.

- Implementation in Concrete Class: The concrete subclass must override all abstract methods from its parent classes.
```Java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}

abstract class Car extends Vehicle {
    // No need to override start() here if not required
    abstract void drive();
}

class Sedan extends Car {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Sedan is starting...");
    }
    
    @Override
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Sedan is driving...");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sedan sedan = new Sedan();
        sedan.start();  // Output: Sedan is starting...
        sedan.drive();  // Output: Sedan is driving...
    }
}
```

#### 5.1.9. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of a single object to be accessed through multiple reference types. In Java, an object can be referenced by its own type, any of its parent classes, or any interface it implements.

Key Points:

- Upcasting: Converting a subclass reference to a superclass or interface reference is implicit and safe. When upcasted, only the methods declared in the parent or interface are directly accessible.

- Downcasting: To access subclass-specific methods from a reference of a superclass, you must explicitly cast (downcast) back to the subclass type. This cast is checked at runtime.
```Java
class Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks: Woof!");
    }
    
    public void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Dog fetches the ball.");
    }
}

public class PolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Animal animalRef = dog;  // Upcasting: implicit, no cast needed
        animalRef.speak();       // Output: Dog barks: Woof!
        // animalRef.fetch();    // Error: fetch() is not defined in Animal
        
        // Downcasting to access Dog-specific method
        if (animalRef instanceof Dog) {
            Dog dogRef = (Dog) animalRef; // Explicit cast (downcasting)
            dogRef.fetch();  // Output: Dog fetches the ball.
        }
    }
}
```

###### Object Identity and Reference Types
- Every object in Java is allocated on the heap and has one unique identity.

- All objects must be accessed using reference variables; you cannot directly manipulate an object's memory.

- Even if you upcast an object (e.g., to Object), the underlying object remains the same. However, you lose direct access to methods or fields not defined in the reference type.

```Java
public class IdentityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Object obj = dog;  // Upcasting to Object
        // Only methods available in Object are accessible through obj.
        System.out.println(obj); // Calls Dog's toString() if overridden.
    }
}
```

###### Rules and Safe Casting
Casting Rules:

- Upcasting: Always safe and implicit.

- Downcasting: Must be explicit; a downcast is allowed only if the object truly is an instance of the target subclass.

- Intra-Hierarchy Casting: Casting is only valid among classes in the same inheritance tree.

- Runtime Check: An invalid cast will result in a ClassCastException.

Avoiding Cast Errors: Use the instanceof operator to check an object’s type before performing a downcast.

```Java
public class SafeCastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();  // Upcasting
        if (animal instanceof Dog) {
            Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Safe downcast
            dog.fetch();
        } else {
            System.out.println("The object is not a Dog.");
        }
    }
}
```

###### Virtual Methods and Polymorphic Parameters
Virtual Method Invocation: In Java, instance methods are virtual by default. This means that the method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object's type—even if it is accessed through a reference variable of a parent type.

```Java
public class VirtualMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
        animal.speak(); // Calls Dog's speak() method because of dynamic dispatch
    }
}
```

Polymorphic Parameters: A method can accept a parameter declared as a superclass or an interface. This allows you to pass any object that is a subtype, thereby promoting code reuse.

```Java
class Printer {
    // Method accepts any List of Animal objects
    public static void printAnimalSounds(List<Animal> animals) {
        for (Animal animal : animals) {
            animal.speak();
        }
    }
}

public class PolymorphicParameterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Animal> animalList = new ArrayList<>();
        animalList.add(new Dog());
        // You can add other Animal subtypes here
        
        Printer.printAnimalSounds(animalList);
        // Output will depend on the actual types in animalList.
    }
}
```

#### 5.1.10. Interface 
Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces: While Java does not allow multiple class inheritance, it permits a class to implement multiple interfaces. An interface defines a contract—a list of abstract methods that other classes must implement.

Declaring and Implementing Interfaces:

- An interface is declared with the interface keyword.

- A class implements an interface using the implements keyword.

- Think of an interface as a contract that specifies what methods a class must provide.

```Java
// Declaration of an interface
public interface Animal {
    void eat();  // abstract method (implicitly public and abstract)
    void sleep();
}

// A class implementing the interface
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats kibble.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog sleeps soundly.");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();
        dog.sleep();
    }
}
```

Inheritance Among Interfaces: An interface can extend one or more other interfaces using the extends keyword. Unlike classes, interfaces support multiple inheritance.
```Java
// Two simple interfaces
public interface Flyer {
    void fly();
}

public interface Swimmer {
    void swim();
}

// An interface that inherits from both Flyer and Swimmer
public interface Amphibious extends Flyer, Swimmer {
    // Additional abstract methods can be declared here
}
```

## 5.2. Method

#### 5.2.1. Method Structure and Components

###### Purpose of a Method
A method encapsulates a piece of behavior or logic that can be executed whenever needed. It allows you to group code into reusable, named units.

###### Components of a Method
- **Return Type**: Defines the type of value the method returns. If a method does not return any value, its return type is declared as `void`. A method can return at most one value.
- **Method Name**: Must be a valid identifier and typically follows naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase`).
- **Parameters**: A list of variables (with types) passed into the method. These parameters must be fully specified. You can declare parameters as `final` if their values should not change within the method.
- **Method Body**: Enclosed in curly braces `{ }`, it contains the statements that define the method’s behavior. Unlike control structures (`if/else`, loops), the method body is a complete block that must be properly delimited.

#### 5.2.2. Return Types and Returning Values

###### Returning a Value
If a method declares a non-`void` return type, it must return a value of that type on every possible execution path; otherwise, the code will not compile.

###### Type Compatibility in Returns
- **Exact Match**: The returned value must match the declared return type.
- **Numeric Promotion**: Java allows returning a value of a narrower numeric type if it can be promoted to the declared return type without loss of information.
- **Autoboxing/Unboxing**: Methods may return primitives or their corresponding wrapper objects. Java handles conversions automatically if the types are compatible.
- **Subtyping**: You can return an object of a subclass if the declared return type is a superclass. (For example, returning a `Banana` object when the return type is `Fruit` is allowed, but not vice versa.)

###### Returning Multiple Values
Java does not support returning multiple values directly. To work around this, you can:
- Return an object (e.g., a custom class or a collection) that groups the values.
- Use arrays or wrapper classes to package multiple values into a single returnable entity.

#### 5.2.3. Method Signature and Overloading

###### Method Signature
The method signature consists of the method name and the parameter list (number, types, and order of parameters). The return type and exception clauses are not part of the signature.

###### Overloading
- You can define multiple methods with the same name in a class as long as their signatures differ.
- Overloading provides flexibility in how a method can be called with different argument types or numbers.
- The compiler distinguishes between overloaded methods solely based on their signatures. Differences in return types or exception declarations do not contribute to the signature.

#### 5.2.4. Overloaded Method Resolution

###### Compilation-Time Selection
The compiler determines which overloaded method to call based on the argument types and the available method signatures.

###### Rules for Resolution
- **Exact Match**: If there’s a method whose parameter types exactly match the call, that method is chosen.
- **Most Specific Match**: When multiple candidates exist, the compiler selects the method whose parameters are the most specific (i.e., closest in the type hierarchy to the provided arguments).

###### Conversion Priority
- Widening Conversions (e.g., `byte` to `int`) are preferred over
- Autoboxing/Unboxing (e.g., converting between primitives and wrappers).
- The compiler uses these rules to ensure that the method invoked is unambiguous and best fits the provided arguments.

#### 5.2.5. Returning Values and Variable References

###### Returning Reference Values
You can return objects directly or by assigning them to a local variable and then returning that variable. In both cases, the returned value is a reference to an object.

###### Important Considerations
- The method’s return value must be assignable to the variable or expression that receives it.
- For static members and instance members, the returned object’s type must match or be compatible (via subtyping or conversion) with the declared return type.

#### 5.2.6. Static vs. Instance Context in Methods

###### Static Members
- Belong to the class rather than any individual instance.
- Can be accessed using the class name and do not require an instance.
- Static methods cannot use the `this` keyword because there is no associated instance.

###### Instance Members
- Belong to a specific object and require a reference variable to access.
- Instance methods can use `this` to refer to the current object.
- When an instance method is invoked, the JVM knows which object's fields and methods to use based on the reference variable provided.

###### Key Point on Access
Although static methods can access static fields (even using the class name), they cannot access instance fields because no instance context is available. Conversely, instance methods can access both instance and static fields.
