## 2.1. Data types

#### Primitive Data Types:
- Designed for Raw Data: These types (e.g., int, float, char, double, long, short) are built into Java and are used to represent simple, raw values.
- Built-In Understanding: Java inherently knows the size, range, and operations applicable to these data types.
- Fundamental Blocks: They form the basic building blocks of Java programs, and more complex data structures can be built by combining them within classes.

#### Reference Data Types:
- Designed for Complex Data: Reference types handle more complex objects (e.g., Student, Course, Grade) that Java doesn't inherently understand.
- Developer-Defined Structure: You define these types using classes, interfaces, or enums, which specify the properties and supported operations for the objects.
- Composite Nature: They can encapsulate both primitive types and other reference types, enabling the creation of complex data models.
- General Category: Any object created from a class, interface, or enum falls under reference data types.

| Name    | Bits | Range                                   | Examples               |
| ------- | ---- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| byte    | 8    | -2^7 to 2^7-1 i.e. -128 to 127          | -1, 0, 1               |
| char    | 16   | 0 to 2^16-1 i.e. 0 to 65,535            | 0, 1, 2, 'a', '\u0061' |
| short   | 16   | -2^15 to 2^15-1 i.e. -32,768 to 32,767  | -1, 2, 3               |
| int     | 32   | -2^31 to 2^31-1                         | -1, 2, 3               |
| long    | 64   | -2^63 to 2^63-1                         | -1, 2, 3               |
| float   | 32   | approximately ±3.40282347E+38F          | 1.1f, 2.0f             |
| double  | 64   | approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 | 1.1, 2.0               |
| boolean | 1    | true or false                           | true, false            |

## 2.2. Primitive Assignment Conversions

#### Widening Conversion (Implicit):
- Occurs when assigning a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., assigning a byte to an int).
- It's safe and automatic because no data is lost—like pouring water from a small bucket into a larger bucket.

#### Narrowing Conversion (Potential Data Loss):
- Happens when assigning a larger data type to a smaller one, which can lead to loss of data ("spillage").
- The compiler normally disallows this to prevent information loss.

#### Implicit Narrowing with Compile-Time Constants:
- If a compile-time constant’s value fits within the range of the target type, the assignment is allowed.
- For example, byte b = 10; is valid because 10 fits within a byte’s range, but byte b = 128; is invalid.
- A final int variable with a constant value that fits the target range can also be assigned (e.g., final int i = 4; byte b = i;).

#### Note on Method Parameters:
- Implicit narrowing is only applicable to variable assignments.
- Passing a larger type to a method expecting a smaller type won’t compile, even if the value could theoretically fit.

## 2.3. Operators and Numeric Promotion Rules

#### Assignment Operators:
- Right Associativity: Expressions like a = b = c = 10; are evaluated from right to left.
- Left-Hand Side (LHS) Restrictions: The LHS must be a variable; literals or method calls (which return a value but not a variable) cannot be assigned to.
- Type Compatibility on the Right-Hand Side (RHS): The RHS expression must be type-compatible with the LHS variable. For primitives, the value must fit in the target type. For reference types, compatibility may involve inheritance and polymorphism.

#### Expressions vs. Statements:

- Expression: Combines operators, values, variables, and functions to produce a value.
- Statement: A complete line of code that can include an expression (e.g., an assignment statement).

#### Increment/Decrement Operators (++, --):
- Prefix (++i): Increments the variable and returns the updated value.
- Postfix (i++): Returns the original value, then increments the variable.
- Underlying Mechanism: These operators perform an expression evaluation and then assign the new value to the variable.
- Wrapper Objects: Incrementing/decrementing a wrapper object creates a new object with the updated value.

#### The "+" and "+=" Operators:
- Dual Functionality: They perform addition for numeric operands and concatenation when at least one operand is a String.
- String Concatenation: Non-String operands are converted using their toString() method (for primitives, via autoboxing).
- Handling Nulls: If a non-String variable is null, the literal "null" is concatenated.
- Restriction on "+=": The left-hand side must be a String variable when using the "+=" operator for concatenation.

#### Numeric Promotion:
- Unary Numeric Promotion: Operands smaller than an int are promoted to int when used with unary operators.
- Binary Numeric Promotion: In binary operations, if any operand is smaller than int, all operands are promoted to int; if one operand is larger, operands are promoted accordingly.
- Compile-Time Constants & Explicit Narrowing: Even if a value fits within a target type’s range, the compiler may require explicit narrowing unless the value is a compile-time constant.

#### Operator Associativity and Evaluation Order:
- Left-Associative Operators: Most operators, including assignment and ternary, group from left to right.
- Use of Parentheses: Parentheses can alter grouping, but the evaluation order remains left-to-right.
- Evaluation Order: Method calls and sub-expressions are evaluated from left to right; if an exception occurs in an early evaluation, subsequent expressions may not be executed.

#### Order of Precedence (Descending):
1. Parentheses ()
2. Unary operators (e.g., !, ++, --, unary + and -)
3. Multiplicative operators (*, /, %)
4. Additive operators (+, -)
5. Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=)
6. Equality operators (==, !=)
7. Logical AND (&&)
8. Logical OR (||)
9. Ternary operator (? :)
10. Assignment operators (including compound assignments like +=, -=)

## 2.4. Condition
#### If Statement:
- Single Statement: If there’s only one statement to execute when the condition is true, curly braces can be omitted.
- Multiple Statements: When executing multiple statements, curly braces are required.
- If-Else: An if statement can be paired with an else block to handle cases when the condition is false.
- An empty if-else (with just semicolons) is syntactically valid.

#### Ternary Operator:
- Syntax: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
- Behavior: The condition must evaluate to a Boolean. If true, the operator returns the first expression; if false, it returns the second.
- Expression vs. Statement: Unlike if-else (which is a statement), the ternary operator is an expression that must produce a value, which can then be assigned to a variable.
- Return Types: The ternary operator can return a Boolean, numeric, or reference type. For numeric expressions, the resulting type follows numeric promotion rules—if necessary, explicit casting is required when assigning to a smaller type.

#### Switch Statement:
- Purpose: Executes code blocks based on the value of a switch expression.
- Case Labels: Case labels must be compile-time constants. They match against the value of the switch expression.
- Allowed Types: 
	- Numeric types: byte, char, short, int (excluding long, float, and double).
	- enum types.
	- String (from Java 7 onward).
- Default Case: An optional default block is executed if none of the case labels match.
- Break Statement: Controls when to exit the switch block. Without break, fall-through occurs, causing subsequent cases to execute until a break is encountered or the switch block ends.
- Expression Usage: The switch can be used as an expression, which means its result can be used in further computations, respecting numeric promotion, casting, and operator precedence rules.

## 2.5. Looping
#### Loop Types:

While Loop: Repeats a block as long as the condition remains true.
```Java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println("While loop iteration: " + i);
    i++;
}
```

Do-While Loop: Similar to while, but the loop body executes at least once before checking the condition.
```Java
int j = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("Do-While loop iteration: " + j);
    j++;
} while (j < 5);
```

For Loop: Consists of initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement; ideal when the number of iterations is known.
```Java
for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
    System.out.println("For loop iteration: " + k);
}
```

For-Each Loop: Iterates over elements in an array or collection.

Type Matching: The declared variable’s type must be compatible with the element type in the array/collection.

Special Cases: For wrapper objects, automatic unboxing/boxing might occur.

#### Nested Loops:
Loops within loops. Optional labels can be assigned to loops to control break and continue statements.

#### Control Flow Statements:

- Break Statement: Immediately terminates the current loop or switch block.

- Continue Statement: Skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration.

## 2.6. Date-Time API

#### 2.6.1. Overview of Java 8 Date-Time API

###### Modernization
In Java 8, Oracle completely revamped the date-time API to replace the old `java.util.Date`/`Calendar` classes with a more consistent and immutable API in the `java.time` package.

###### Core Classes
The API introduces “local” classes that do not hold time zone information:
- **LocalDate**: Represents a date (year, month, day) in ISO format.
- **LocalTime**: Represents a time (hour, minute, second, nanosecond) in 24-hour format.
- **LocalDateTime**: Combines date and time into one object.

###### Design Principle
These classes are immutable and thread-safe. They are created using static factory methods (e.g., `now()`, `of()`, and `parse()`), not public constructors.

## 2.6.2. Creating and Manipulating Date-Time Objects

###### Obtaining the Current Date/Time
Each class provides a static `now()` method:
- `LocalDate.now()`
- `LocalTime.now()`
- `LocalDateTime.now()`

###### Factory Methods for Specific Values
To create date-time objects with specific values, use the `of()` method. For example, you can create a `LocalDate` for December 25, 2021, a `LocalTime` for 14:30:00, or a `LocalDateTime` combining both.

###### Immutability and Modification
Since date-time objects are immutable, any manipulation (like adding days or hours) returns a new object. For example, adding 10 days to a `LocalDate` creates a new `LocalDate` object. You must reassign the result to a variable if you want to use the updated value.

###### Input Validation
These classes validate input values (e.g., month values must be 1–12, days must be valid for the month). Invalid inputs throw exceptions at runtime.

## 2.6.3. Periods, Durations, and Formatting

###### Period and Duration
- **Period**: Represents a date-based amount of time (years, months, days). It is used for human-scale time differences (e.g., “3 years, 2 months, 5 days”). Created via methods like `Period.ofDays(10)` or `Period.between(startDate, endDate)`.
- **Duration**: Represents a time-based amount of time (seconds, nanoseconds) used for machine-scale time.

###### DateTimeFormatter
A utility class for formatting and parsing date-time objects.
- Predefined formatters (like `ISO_LOCAL_DATE`) follow the ISO-8601 standard (e.g., “YYYY-MM-DD”).
- You can also create custom formatters with patterns that include tokens such as:
  - `"y"` for year, `"M"` for month, `"d"` for day,
  - `"H"` for hour (24-hour clock), `"m"` for minute, `"s"` for second, and `"n"` for nanosecond.
- The `format()` method in each date-time class uses a formatter to convert the object into a `String`.

## 2.6.4. Parsing and Advanced Usage

###### Parsing Strings to Date-Time Objects
Use the `parse()` method with a formatter if your string is not in ISO format. For example, you can parse a date string like "12/25/2021" with a custom formatter for the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy". If no formatter is provided, Java assumes the ISO-8601 format.

###### Special Considerations
- Epoch and Unix Time: Methods like `toEpochSecond()` (available in `LocalDateTime` when combined with a time zone) count seconds from the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00). Unix time is widely used to measure time.
-  Immutability & Reassignment: Changing a date-time value always produces a new object—you must assign it to a variable if you need the updated value.
- Combining Date and Time: You can combine a `LocalDate` and a `LocalTime` into a `LocalDateTime` using the `atTime()` method.
- Edge Cases: Java enforces valid ranges (e.g., months 1–12); however, some parameters like nanoseconds allow a wide range of values as long as they follow ISO rules.

## 2.7. Lambda 
#### 2.7.1. Overview
- Core Concepts: Although Java’s core is object-oriented, Java 8 introduced a new style of programming called functional programming.

- Declarative Style: Functional (or declarative) programming focuses on what needs to be done (the “what”) instead of how to do it (the “how”), which often leads to more concise and readable code.

- Lambda Expressions: Lambda expressions are a central feature in functional programming. They let you define anonymous functions (code blocks) that can be passed as parameters, stored in variables, or returned from methods—much like methods but without a name.


## 2.7.2. Lambda Expressions: Syntax and Semantics
- Basic Syntax: A lambda expression has parameters, an arrow (->), and a body.
``` Java
(parameters) -> expression
(parameters) -> { statements; }
```
- Anonymous Methods: Lambdas act like anonymous methods. They have parameters and a body, but no name. They are used in place of writing full method implementations when only a single behavior is required.
``` Java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello(String name);
}

public class AnonymousMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Lambda expression as an anonymous method.
        // We do not specify the type for 'name' because it is inferred from the Greeting interface.
        Greeting greeting = (name) -> {
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        };

        // Calling the anonymous method
        greeting.sayHello("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
    }
}
```
- Type Inference: Parameter types are inferred, so you often don’t need to explicitly declare them.
```Java
public class TypeInferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Runnable is a functional interface with a single abstract method 'run()'
        // Here, no parameters are needed; the lambda expression uses type inference automatically.
        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Running with type inference!");
        
        // Executing the runnable task
        task.run(); // Output: Running with type inference!
    }
}
```
- Example Usage: Lambdas are typically used with functional interfaces—interfaces that have exactly one abstract method.
